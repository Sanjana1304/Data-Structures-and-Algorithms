# Stacks

This folder will give you the basic knowledge of stack in the readme file and its implementations in the above java files.

## Introduction
The stack data structure is a linear data structure that accompanies a principle known as LIFO (Last In First Out)

Examples : 

- deck of cards
- piles of books
- piles of money

## Basic Operations on Stack in Data Structures

### Push Operation

Adding element at the top

### Peek Operation

Peek operation refers to retrieving the topmost element in the stack without removing it from the collections of data elements.

### isFull()

isFull function is used to check whether or not a stack is empty.

### isEmpty()

isEmpty function is used to check whether or not a stack is empty.

#### You'll learn how to implement the above functions in the .java files

## Stacks can be implemented using:
- Array (Refer StackImplementation_Array.java file)

- Linked List (Refer StackImplementation_LL.java file)


### Built on:
- Visual Studio Code
