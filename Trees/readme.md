# Trees

## Introduction

- Tree is a non sequential, non linear and hierarchical data structure. Using trees we can store data in a hierarchical manner. 
- In tree data structure, every individual element is called as Node. Node in a tree data structure, stores the actual data of that particular element and link to next element in hierarchical structure. 
- A tree can also be defined as a collection of 'N' nodes out of which one designated as root node and 'N-1' edges such these 'N-1' edges follows from the fact that each edge connects some node to its parent and every node expect the root has one parent and also any child can have only one parent.

## Binary Tree

Binary Tree is a special kind of tree in which every node can have a maximum of 2 child nodes. 

### Types
- Full binary tree
- Complete binary tree
- Perfect binary tree
- Extended binary tree
- Balanced binary tree

### Binary Tree Traversals

 1. Depth first traversals
- In- order traversal.
- Pre - order traversal.
- Post - order traversal.
 2. Breath first traversals.

## Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree, is a binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
- The left sub tree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right sub tree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right sub tree each must also be a binary search tree.
- There must be no duplicate nodes.
